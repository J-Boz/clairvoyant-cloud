# clairvoyant-cloud  

The Clairvoyant Cloud is an IOT swag lamp that retrieves weather data from the Open Weather Network and displays a matching colour.

Additionally, the cloud is controlled via the Blynk iOS App and has additional lighting modes of RBG Selection and Party (Disco).

## Technology & Hardware Utilised

- Arduino Pro Mini
- Sparkfun Thing Dev
- Solderable Breadboard 
- 1000μF Capacitor
- 330Ω Resistor
- 5v6A Power Supply
- 120 Addressable RGB LEDs (2x 1m Strips of 60LEDs)

## Resources & Journey

The original idea for a cloud lamp was from seeing the Artist: Richard Clarckson's version that contained speakers and lit up to match the sounds of thunder from within. 

I wanted to create something similar but wondered if the cloud could instead display the weather through an API. 

Just my luck, as it was quite complicated for green electronics / coding student I found SparkFun had created almost exactly what I wanted to acheive. Their project can be viewed [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/led-cloud-connected-cloud).

I set to work creating their version of the cloud and refactored the code as I went. Unravling each block and tweaking it to conform to my particular hardware and LED spec. 

Here are a few photos of my journey through the process of shopping, configuring, coding, testing and soldering. (In reverse cronological order)
