# clairvoyant-cloud  

The Clairvoyant Cloud is an IOT swag lamp that retrieves weather data from the Open Weather Network and displays a matching colour.

Additionally, the cloud is controlled via the Blynk iOS App and has additional lighting modes of RBG Selection and Party (Disco).

## Technology & Hardware Utilised

- Arduino Pro Mini
- Sparkfun Thing Dev
- Solderable Breadboard 
- 1000μF Capacitor
- 330Ω Resistor
- 5v6A Power Supply
- 120 Addressable RGB LEDs (2x 1m Strips of 60LEDs)

## Resources & Journey

The original idea for a cloud lamp was from seeing the Artist: Richard Clarckson's version that contained speakers and lit up to match the sounds of thunder from within. 

I wanted to create something similar but wondered if the cloud could instead display the weather through an API. 

Just my luck, as it was quite complicated for green electronics / coding student I found SparkFun had created almost exactly what I wanted to acheive. Their project can be viewed [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/led-cloud-connected-cloud).

I set to work creating their version of the cloud and refactored the code as I went. Unravling each block and tweaking it to conform to my particular hardware and LED spec. 

My journey was a lengthy one through the process of purchasing equipment/materials, configuring hardware, coding, testing and soldering.
I still have a few things I want to change/add to this project - and even though it was a little complicated for a beginner, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to tinker with electornics, code and smart lighting that are willing to jump in the deep end. The learning curve was steep but well worth it.  -JG
